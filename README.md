We kindly refer you to [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05151):
* This is the first coreset paper for Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNN).
* This coreset can serve a large family of functions that can be represented by any RBFNN model.
* Finally, our coreset can be used for the task of subset selection in the context of training deep neural networks.


In this repository, you will find our coreset construction code (tested with Python 3.9).
